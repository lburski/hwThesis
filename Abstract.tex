Proving formal specifications in order to find logical errors is often a difficult and labour-intensive task. This thesis introduces a new and stepwise toolkit to assist in the translation of formal specifications into theorem provers, using a number of simple steps based on the MathLang Framework. By following these steps, the translation path between a Z specification and a formal proof in Isabelle could be carried out even by one who is not proficient in theorem proving.\\
