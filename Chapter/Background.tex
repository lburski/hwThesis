Introduction stating formal methods are a type of mathematics. Explanation of where formal languages came from in mathematics etc

\section{History of mathematics}

Intro....

\subsection{Right from the begininning}

\begin{itemize}
\item logic and aristotle

\item Frege Grundgesetze + Cantor + Russel discovered paradoxes

\item Russel inventing type theory

\item Zermelo added axiomisation

\item Fraenkel + skolem extended to ZF set theory (which Z is based on)

\end{itemize}

\section{History of formal methods and formal languages}

{\color{red}I don't know if history of formal methods should be a seperate section or keep it as a subsection under `history of mathematics'.}

\begin{itemize}
\item definitions of `formal language', `formal method' and `formal specification'

\item the first formal language is thought to be used by Frege in his Begriffsschift (1879), Begriffschift meaning `concept of writing' described as `formal language of pure thoguht'

\item broad histroy of formal methods 

\begin{itemize}
\item 1940's, Alan Turing annotated the properties of program states to simplify the logical analysus of sequential programs

\item 1960's Floyd, Hoare and Naur recommended using axiomatic techniques to prove programs meet their specification.

\item 1970's Dijkstra used formal caluculus to aid development of non-deterinist programs
\end{itemize}

\item Formal methods today

\item why use formal methods in industry (design errors like Therac-25 1985, NASA’s Checkout Launch and Control System (CLCS) cancelled 9/2002, , added level of rigor)

\item types of formal methods (Z, B method, ABS)

\item Success of formal methods (B27 Traffic Control System, SHOLIS project, Data Acquisition, Monitoring and Commanding of Space Equipment)

\item Weakness of formal methods (Low-level ontologies, Limited Scope,Cost,Poor tool feedback)

\item What needs to be done to make “formal methods” industrial strength? 
\begin{itemize}
\item Bridge gap between real world and mathematics
\item Mapping from formal specifications to code (preferably automated)
\item Patterns identified
\item Level of abstraction should be supported
\item Tools needed to hide complexity of formalism
\item Provide visualization of specifications 
\item Certain activities not yet ‘formulizable’ methods
\item No one model has been identified which should be used for software)
\end{itemize}
ZMathLang covers items 1, 3, 5, 6, 7(semi formal spec)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Conclusion}

\section{Z Syntax and semantics}

\section{Proving systems for Z}

\subsection{Levels of Rigor}

\begin{itemize}
\item Level 1 represents the use of mathematical logic to specify the system.
\item Level 2 uses pencil-and-paper proofs.
\item Level 3 is the most rigorous application of formal methods.

\end{itemize}
