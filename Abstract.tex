High integrity system specifications are very difficult to analyse and check for
correctness, whether they are written formally, informally or are on the way to
being formalised. A lot of these specifications are written by many different
stakeholders and therefore it is a laborious task bringing all the components
together. This thesis introduces and new and stepwise toolkit to assist the
translation of formal specifications into theorem provers based on the MathLang Framework. Each step comes with
it's own correctness checks, some of which can be done on informal as well as
formal specifications. Some steps can be done on their own
or all together in sequence to translate a formal specifications into a formal
proof in Isabelle, even by one who is not proficient in theorem proving. The
ZMathLang toolkit allows users to bring their specifications together and helps
to manage all the components.
