% Write case studies
% Discuss Case Studies
% Write how many lines of code, pages of schemas etc 
% Divide case studies in similar ones, eg which ones uses only terms, which ones uses terms and sets, which ones doesnt have state invariants
% Any assumptions  made

%reflect on the amount and complexity of manual proof still needed, and in particular whether this should
%be within grasp of a software/system designer, who is not necessarily an expert in Isabelle/HOL.
